# Tennis Match Winner Prediction

## Project Plan

### Objective
Develop a Python-based system to predict the winners of all available singles matches, including tournament winners, using historical data from the tennis_atp GitHub repository. The system will:
- Aggregate data into a single CSV
- Incorporate an Elo rating system and other features
- Train an XGBoost model
- Predict future match outcomes based on user-provided inputs (e.g., player names, match details like surface)

The priority is maximizing prediction accuracy, with considerations for limited computational resources.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Acquisition and Aggregation
**Task:** Collect and merge all relevant CSV files from the tennis_atp repository into a single dataset.

**Details:**
- Identify all CSV files containing singles match data (e.g., files like atp_matches_YYYY.csv)
- Download files and combine them into one comprehensive dataset
- Ensure all available singles matches are included, excluding doubles matches

**Output:** A single CSV file containing all historical singles match data.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
**Task:** Prepare the aggregated dataset for analysis and modeling.

**Details:**
- Filter out doubles matches and retain only singles matches
- Address missing or inconsistent data (e.g., impute missing values or remove incomplete records)
- Standardize data formats across years for consistency
- Sort the dataset chronologically by match date to maintain temporal integrity

**Output:** A clean, standardized dataset of singles matches ready for feature engineering.

### 3. Feature Engineering
**Task:** Generate features to improve prediction accuracy, including an Elo rating system.

**Details:**

#### Elo Ratings:
- Create an Elo rating system to quantify player performance
- Assign initial ratings to all players and update them after each match based on outcomes
- Calculate ratings in chronological order to reflect historical performance accurately

#### Additional Features:
- Include all possible features to test their effectiveness, such as:
  - Surface type (e.g., hard, clay, grass)
  - Tournament level and round
  - Player form (e.g., recent wins/losses)
  - Head-to-head records between players
  - Any other available match or player statistics

**Output:** An enriched dataset with Elo ratings and a comprehensive set of features.

### 4. Model Development
**Task:** Build and train an XGBoost model to predict match winners with high accuracy.

**Details:**

#### Data Preparation:
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets, preserving chronological order to avoid data leakage
- Use a significant portion of historical data for training and recent matches for testing

#### Feature Selection:
- Incorporate Elo ratings and all engineered features as inputs
- Test various feature combinations to identify the most predictive ones

#### Model Training:
- Implement the XGBoost algorithm with a focus on optimizing accuracy
- Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation to enhance performance

#### Evaluation:
- Measure accuracy as the primary metric, supplemented by other relevant metrics (e.g., precision, recall)
- Analyze feature importance to refine the model

**Output:** A trained XGBoost model optimized for predicting singles match winners.

### 5. Prediction Pipeline
**Task:** Create a system to predict future match outcomes based on user inputs.

**Details:**

#### Input:
- Player names
- Match details (e.g., surface, tournament level, round)

#### Processing:
- Retrieve current Elo ratings for the specified players
- Compute additional features based on the input (e.g., head-to-head stats)

#### Prediction:
- Use the trained XGBoost model to predict the winner and provide a confidence score

**Output:** Predicted match winner with an associated probability, delivered to the user.

### 6. Optimization and Scalability
**Task:** Ensure the system operates efficiently given limited computational power.

**Details:**
- Optimize data processing and model training to minimize memory and CPU usage
- Explore cloud processing options for resource-intensive tasks (e.g., training on large datasets)
- Implement batch processing or data chunking if needed to handle the full dataset

**Output:** A scalable and efficient prediction system that accommodates hardware constraints.

## Key Considerations
- **Accuracy Priority:** Focus on maximizing prediction accuracy through robust feature engineering and model tuning
- **Comprehensive Match Coverage:** Include all available singles matches and predict tournament winners by modeling each match in sequence
- **Computational Limits:** Balance processing demands with your machine's capabilities, leveraging cloud resources if necessary
- **Feature Testing:** Experiment with all possible features to determine what works best, refining based on model performance
